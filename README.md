# Potato Leaf Disease Detection

This project focuses on determining whether a potato plant has a disease by analyzing images of its leaves. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system categorizes leaf images into distinct classes to identify specific diseases or healthy plants. The model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions.

## Project Overview

- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Dataset**: PlantVillage Dataset - Potato Leaf Images
- **Classes**: Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit for deployment
- **Deployment**: Web application on Streamlit

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The CNN model categorizes leaf images into different disease classes.
- **Interactive Application**: A user-friendly Streamlit interface that accepts uploaded images and returns disease predictions.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Provides instant feedback on the health status of the uploaded potato leaf image.
